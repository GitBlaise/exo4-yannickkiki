# Exercise4: Encode decode files

For this exercise, you are invited to write a program that allows you to 
**encode** and **decode** a file (any type).

You will take the file at the binary level so the file type should not be a 
problem.

The purpose of this exercise is to be able to take a file, encode it and 
decode it, which implies that the file obtained must be exactly the same file 
as at the beginning.

When you encode a file, you are required to put **enc_** at the beginning and 
when you decode one, you put **dec_** at the beginning which allows us to have 
this scenario:

*We have the file **file.extension**. We use our program to encode it and we 
obtain **enc_file.extension**. After that, we can also use our program to decode 
it and we obtain **dec_enc_file.extension** who is supposed to be as same as our 
file **file.extension***

For more comprehension, you can look at the **encode_decode** folder or you can 
ask questions to tech leads.

Your task is to :
- [ ] Write your program in the `exercice4.your_language_extension` file
- [ ] Write clear, clean and readable code
- [ ] Comment your code as much as possible
- [ ] Write less than 80 characters per line (you can fix it with your text 
editor)
- [ ] Describe briefy in a file named **howto.md** how to use your 
program to encode a file , how to use it to decode a file and the 
algorithm(s) you have used
