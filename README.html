<h1>Exercise4: Encode decode files</h1>
<p>For this exercise, you are invited to write a program that allows you to 
<strong>encode</strong> and <strong>decode</strong> a file (any type).</p>
<p>You will take the file at the binary level so the file type should not be a 
problem.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to be able to take a file, encode it and 
decode it, which implies that the file obtained must be exactly the same file 
as at the beginning.</p>
<p>When you encode a file, you are required to put <strong>enc_</strong> at the beginning and 
when you decode one, you put <strong>dec_</strong> at the beginning which allows us to have 
this scenario:</p>
<p><em>We have the file <strong>file.extension</strong>. We use our program to encode it and we 
obtain <strong>enc_file.extension</strong>. After that, we can also use our program to decode 
it and we obtain <strong>dec_enc_file.extension</strong> who is supposed to be as same as our 
file <strong>file.extension</strong></em></p>
<p>For more comprehension, you can look at the <strong>encode_decode</strong> folder or you can 
ask questions to tech leads.</p>
<p>Your task is to :
- [ ] Write your program in the <code>exercice4.your_language_extension</code> file
- [ ] Write clear, clean and readable code
- [ ] Comment your code as much as possible
- [ ] Write less than 80 characters per line (you can fix it with your text 
editor)
- [ ] Describe briefy in a file named <strong>howto.md</strong> how to use your 
program to encode a file , how to use it to decode a file and the 
algorithm(s) you have used  </p>
